This example shows how to

- Read from a csv file to extra data
- Display the data in a table in HTML
- Provide a simple search on the name field

Things that should further be done:

- Break up HTML file into CSS and JS files
- Create different JS functions for creating the Table vs Searching
- Figure out how to search on specific fields rather than just search on Name field
- In search, if it's a field with limited values, extract the possible values so user can select from a list rather than type in free text (e.g., Category search should list the values from the data, not require the user to guess what they might be)
